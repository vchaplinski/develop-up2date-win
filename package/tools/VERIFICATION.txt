VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
Depending on what operating system you are using, once you have obtain the required file you can compute a hash of it. First navigate to the directory of the file you obtained, than:
Windows
CertUtil -hashfile filename SHA256
Linux
sha256sum filename
MacOS
shasum -a 256 filename
The issue that comes with checking a hash from a website is that it doesn't determine that the file is safe to use, just that what you have obtained is the correct file, byte for byte. If the website has been compromised then you could be shown the hash for a different file, which in turn could be malicious.
