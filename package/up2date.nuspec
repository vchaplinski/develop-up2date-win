    <summary>RITMS UP2DATE Client</summary>
    <description>RITMS UP2DATE is a cloud ready solution for unified software and firmware management.

RITMS UP2DATE is based on open and worldwide adopted building blocks, the most important is Eclipse Hawkbit which provides open and flexible Direct Device Integration (DDI) API and Management API.

RITMS UP2DATE extends Eclipse Hawkbit API with zero-cost maintenance device provisioning based on X509 certificates. The Public Key Infrastructure deployed to cloud governs digital certificates to secure end-to-end communications. Devices are automatically provisioned to connect the update service in a secure way.

This UP2DATE CLIENT for Windows is a reference implementation of general purpose client service.

BASIC USE CASE:
Rollout any software deployment packaged as MSI (or, optionally choco nuget package) to all connected PCs.</description>
